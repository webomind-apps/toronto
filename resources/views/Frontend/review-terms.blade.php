                <p >
                    Toronto Connection has created this privacy statement (the statement) and is firmly committed
                    to the protection of your privacy. This Statement sets out how we collect, use and secure the
                    personal information of individuals on Toronto Connection. This Statement reflects the
                    requirements of Canada’s Federal and Provincial privacy legislation as well as our continuous
                    commitment to protecting your personal information.
                </p>

                <p>
                    BY USING TORONTO CONNECTION WEBSITE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE FOLLOWING
                    PRIVACY STATEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS STATEMENT, DISCONTINUE ALL USE
                    OF THIS SITE IMMEDIATELY.
                </p>

                       <h5>1. What is “Personal Information” ?</h5>
                       <p>
                            Personal information is information about you that uniquely identifies you as an individual.
                            Your name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number are all examples of personal
                            information. However, the name, address and telephone number of an individual that appears
                            in a telephone directory that is available to the public (where such individual can refuse to have
                            such information appears in such directory) does not fall under the scope of personal
                            information as it is publicly available information. Also, in some circumstances, some of this
                            information may qualify as business information which is not covered by this Statement.
                       </p>

                        <h5>2. Collection of Personal Information</h5>
                        <p>
                            We do not automatically gather any personal information from users of Toronto Connection
                            Website. Personal information is only obtained online if you supply it voluntarily, usually
                            through contacting us via e-mail, applying online for a contest, answering online surveys,
                            submitting a posting to a blog, forum, or review or registering for services. You are not required
                            to supply personal information to view the content of Toronto Connection Website. You should
                            also be aware that when you share personal information in public areas of Toronto Connection
                            Website, this information may be seen and used by others users. We urge you to exercise good
                            judgment when sharing personal information in these areas.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If you decide not to provide us with personal information online, no material consequences will
                            result, although you may be unable to participate in certain promotions, receive product
                            information, or use portions of Toronto Connection Website that require personalized
                            information or applications. Toronto Connection Website provides users the opportunity to
                            opt-out of receiving communications from us at the point where we request contact
